<!-- ##### Difference between probability and statistics

Probability -->


An experiment is any procedure that can result in one or more outcomes. It doesn't necessarily involve a physical action; int can be a mental process or even a theoretical  consturct. 
For example:
flipping a coin 
rolling a dine
surbeying people about their favorite color
observing the weather

**Sample space**
the set of all possible outcomes in an experiment, denoted by the symbol S.
Sample space for flipping a coin:
S = {heads, tails}
Sample space for rolling a dice
S = { 1,2,3,4,5,6}

**Event**
An event is a set of outcomes 
For example:
- getting a "heads" when you flip a coin is an event 
- rolling an even number on a die is an event
- predicting the chance of rain tomorrow is an event. I guess here the sample space would be rain or sunshine. 

Probaility is a measure if likelihood that an event will occur. It is a number between 0 and 1, inclusive. 
- a probability of 0 menas the event is impossible. 
- a probablity of 1 menas the event is certain
- a probability between 0 an 1 indicates the event's likelihood lies somewhere in between. 
Negative probability? Can the probability be more than 1? Why or why not?

P(E) - probability of an event

*Example one*
So, if a two sided coin is flipped, using the P(E) formula:

The sample space is: S = {heads, tails}
The event we are looking for is heads; therefore, the probability of heads is 1/2 or 0.5 which is 50%. 
The P(heads) = 0.5.

*Example two*

P(E) - probability of an event 
Tossing a die
If a fair 6 face die is tossed, using the P(E) formula:
We want to see the probability of getting an odd number. 

S = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
Event = {1,3,5}
These are three out of the 6 in the sample space. 
Therefore
P(odd-number) = 3/6 = 0.5 = 50%


Conclusion
P(E)
- number of outcomes (events) divided by total number of outcomes or sample space. 


Assignment
Using the dataset diamonds_new.xlsx, let's figure out the probability of premium diamond. 
What is the probability of having a "J" colored diamond?
